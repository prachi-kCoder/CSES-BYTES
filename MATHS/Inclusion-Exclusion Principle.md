# Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

- You may know :
```

n(A) + n (B) - n(A ^ B) = n (A U B)
n(A) + n (B) + n(C) - n(A ^ B) - n(B ^ C) - n(A ^ C) + n(A ^ B ^ C) = n (A U B)
...
 more geralised way is :
  - For Even count of sets {We take the subtraction of their intersection}
  - For ODD count of sets {We take the addition of their intersection}

```


- This  applied in prime multiple if cses maths
